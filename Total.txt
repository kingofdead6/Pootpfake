i have this code make it more larger and add to it all the possible functions that might be asked and needed considering this exercice text 
A transport company wants to design and implement an application to manage the public
transportation system of a city. Each mode of transport is characterized by its code, the
transport line it serves, the type of power supply (Diesel, Electricity, Hybrid), and the number of
kilometers traveled.

To travel, a passenger is required to obtain a fare medium from the station counter (a fare
medium is an item that grants access to transport services such as tickets or passes). It can be
paid in cash, with a Dahabia card, ar via the BaridiMob application. A fare medium is
characterized by its identifier, purchase date and time, served zones (center, periphery, or both),
activation date and time (first trip), price, and payment method (cash, Dahabia card, BaridiMob
app). Before boarding a mode of transport, the passenger validates their fare medium using a
magnetic reader at the station, which then grants access. Each station has a counter and at least
one magnetic reader. A passenger can buy multiple fare media.

The company wants to identify each passenger by a number and record the station where the
purchase was made for statistical purposes.

A transport line is served by a single mode of transport and follows a fixed route with multiple
stations. It is defined by a unique number, a total length in kilometers, an ordered list of stations
where it stops (at least three stations), and an operating schedule (first and last departures).
A station is a stopping point on a transport line and is defined by a unique code, a name, the
municipality where it is located, its location zone (city center or periphery), a single counter for
fare media purchases, and at least one magnetic reader for fare validation. A station can be
served by multiple lines.

Stations and modes of transport can be either operational (in service) or suspended
(temporarily deactivated for maintenance reasons).

to ensure quality of service, the company allows passengers to report issues via the application
related to their travel experience. Each complaint is analyzed within 24 hours of being reported.
It may be rejected if unfounded, or approved and then sent for processing. Each complaint is 
identified by a number, the person who submitted it (either a passenger or an employee of the
company : station agent or driver), an optional short description of the issue, and the report
date. Each complaint is linked to the station where it was reported. If the complaint relates to a
mode of transport, the person submitting it can specify the departure or arrival station, allowing
the relevant service at that station to process the request.A person can report multiple complaints if they wish.

We identify three types of complaints: (1) Technical complaints: These concern technical
malfunctions of transport modes or stations. They are characterized by the type of issue, which
can be: inaccurate/missing schedule displays, air conditioning/heating issues in the vehicle or
the station, sound system problems, defective fare reader; the mode of transport or the station
concerned by the technical issue, along with its severity level (low, medium, high). The severity
is assessed by the station's service handling the complaint (2) Fare payment complaints: These
relate to issues with financial transactions. They are characterized by the amount involved and
the payment method used. (3) Service and safety complaints: These complaints relate to
interactions with staff and passenger safety. They are categorized by the type of issue, which
may involve inappropriate behavior, assault, or theft.

If a mode of transport or a station receives more than three approved technical complaints with
a high severity level within 24 hours, it is automatically suspended for inspection and
maintenance. The suspension is lifted once all complaints have been processed by the relevant
services, and their status is updated to 'resolved'. During the suspension and after the
reactivation of stations or modes of transport, passengers are informed through announcements
displayed at stations and on the application.

The system must provide the following features:
Manage fare medium sales transactions
   The system must allow for displaying the purchase history of fare media by station.
   It must also support generating revenue reports by payment method (cash,Dahabia card, BaridiMob app).

Analyze transportation usage
   the system must record the number of visitors - defined as passengers who have validated a fare medium - entering a station during a given time period.
   It may also provide statistics on peak and off-peak days of the week
Manage the status of transport modes and stations
   The system must allow for displaying the number and types of complaints per station or mode of transport.
   It must also provide the total number of suspended stations and modes of transport
